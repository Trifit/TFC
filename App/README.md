This project is to provide a tool for teachers and students to have a better understanding of
the campus, using their Android device.

During this project we will do a aproximation to Android operating sistem, one of the most
popular sistems in movile devices, at this moment together with IOS, Apple's operating
sistem. Android is a open code sistem and Java based, that and his popularity created a
strong scene and plenty of information about, and plenty of experimented users.
To acomplish our objective, used also the QR codes as marquers that will allow us obtain
more info related with the class related with it, showing us the subject that is being done at
that moment and who will do the next one.

Also, thanks to this aplication we will acces to a database of teachers, subjects and
classes, and information related, it will be a reduced version of the virtual campus.
At the end of this project, we intend to do a aproximation at the design proces, that as
enginiers are not completly aware, but of high importance due that simplifies our work
helping to stablish a visual stile for our aplication, a comon and standarized look in the
diferent screens of the aplication and to stablish the limits of it without having to code anithing.
